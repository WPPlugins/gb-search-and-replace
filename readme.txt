== Frequently Asked Questions ==
* *The plugin alerts "Please select where you want to search", what does that mean?*
It means, you didn’t check any of the posts, pages or custom post types found in the "Search in list". Please check the checkbox of the location where you want to look.

* *After I pressed "GO" I see the names of the posts where I have the search key but I don’t see the text with the Keyes highlighted.*
To view the text with the highlighted search keys, you must click on the post title. The text should appear with the search keys highlighted.

* *After I pressed "GO" and reviewed the search keys, I have tried to press "Replace", but the button is disabled and cannot be pressed.*
You must select at least one post, page or custom post type from the results given, then the button unlocks and you can click it to do the "replace" action.

* *The plugin indicates that I have 8 keys to replace, 5- red and 3- green. But when I look at the text I only see 5 highlighted keys. Why is that?*
The red digit indicates how many search keys were found in total in that particular post, page or custom post type. The green digit indicates, how many of the found keys can be replaced safely.

* *What kind of data can be replaced?*
All strings and HTML tags can be replaced except for the "serialized strings", such as the "options table". This upgrade is coming soon in the much anticipated premium version. 

* *What can happen if I change a key highlighted in red?*
If you are familiar with HTML, you and your site should be fine. On the other hand if you don’t know HTML, changing an existing tag can cause a lot of damage to your site. If you aren’t sure, don’t hesitate to contact us for support. In any case don’t forget to backup your database.
